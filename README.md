# University of London - Introduction to Programming I Final Project
## Coin Collector Game
This project is the final submission for the University of London module "Introduction to Programming I." It involves creating a simple game using JavaScript that allows players to collect coins while navigating through a basic design. The game is designed with three lives for the player, who can move using the arrow keys and jump using the space bar.

## Gameplay
- Objective: Collect as many coins as possible while avoiding obstacles.
- Controls: Use the arrow keys to move left or right. Press the space bar to jump.
- Lives: The player starts with three lives. Colliding with obstacles reduces the number of lives.
- Scoring: Each collected coin adds points to the player's score.
- End Game: The game ends when all three lives are lost. The final score is displayed.

## Running the Game
To run the game locally:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open index.html in a web browser that supports JavaScript.

## Development Details
The game is built entirely using JavaScript for the logic and basic HTML for the user interface.
